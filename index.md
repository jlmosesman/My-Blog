# Hello World!
-------------
## Welcome to my own personal blogz

Here I will share what I know, what I don't know, and what I'm really confused about in hopes of finding answers.

I will also be trying to use Markdown in a way that shows I know how to use it, for example by:

```markdown
Using headers like

## This
and
# This

creating lists like

1. This
and
2. This

and especially **bolding** and _italicizing_ and `coding` accordingly.
```
